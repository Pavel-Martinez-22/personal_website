		<p>Welcome to my portfolio of projects created for the HTML &amp; CSS class. The purpose of this website is to
			demonstrate my knowledge of HTML &amp; CSS and to showcase my ability to produce webpages. You can visit the
			project links below to see the new skills I am learning every week.</p>

		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>My name is Pavel Martinez, and I am currently a teacher for USD 259. I mainly teach introductory computer
			courses like Photoshop, Premiere, HTML &amp; CSS. I have been teaching for seven years and I really enjoy
			what I do! I am a part-time student at Butler Community College and by taking this course I hope to advance
			my skills to better teach my content.</p>

		<p>Some of my hobbies include playing video games, tinkering with Adobe software, and watching YouTube videos on
			new technology. I am very technology focused and I always like to learn about the newest technology out
			there. Sometimes it can get overwhelming when it is not working but it is always fun to investigate the
			settings and see what options developers have added. It fascinates me how technology is always evolving and
			making life a little simpler.
		<p>

		<h3> Favorite Quote</h3>
		<p>As a teacher, sometimes I come across great TED Talks. Here is a great quote from professional educator Rita
			Person:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p><em>&ldquo;Every child deserves a champion: an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the
					power of connection and insists they become the best they can possibly be.&rdquo;</em></p>

			<p><cite>Person, R. &lpar;n.d.&rpar;. Every kid needs a champion. Retrieved February 10, 2021, from<br>
					https://www.ted.com/talks/rita_pierson_every_kid_needs_a_champion?language=en</cite></p>
		</blockquote>
